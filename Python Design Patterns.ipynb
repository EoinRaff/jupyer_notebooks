    "Despite being one of the original Group of Four design patterns, the Singleton is declining in popularity. Many developers consider it an \"anti-pattern\", as it is often used in a way that flys in the face of SOLID principles. However the issue lies not necessarily with the singleton itself, but rather with the way in which it is used."

This is a class which contains a variable ```__instance``` (note the meaning of the leading ```__``` is somewhat complicated, read about underscores in Python [here](https://dbader.org/blog/meaning-of-underscores-in-python)). This is functionally similar to a private variable.\n",
